PIPA is, for the moment, dead in the water.  Reid is not going to vote
on cloture.  His [statement][] reads, in part:

> ...Counterfeiting and piracy cost the American economy billions of
> dollars and thousands of jobs each year, with the movie industry
> alone supporting over 2.2 million jobs...

  [statement]: http://democrats.senate.gov/2012/01/20/reid-statement-on-intellectual-property-bill/

The part about "supporting 2.2 million jobs" looked familiar.  Last
night, I checked out [mpaa.org][] when I heard that anonymous had
knocked it down.  It was already back up, and displayed prominently on
the main page was the same "supporting 2.2 million jobs" claim.  In
[more detail][]:

  [mpaa.org]: http://mpaa.org/

> We support a national community of 2.2 million workers — costume
> designers to make-up artists, stuntmen to set builders, writers to
> actors, accountants to dry cleaners — employed in all 50 states of
> our union.

Their [PDF fact sheet][] breaks things down a little more:

OK, so "support" means "do business with."  Fair enough, and by that
metric I alone supported hundreds of grocers, bartenders, video
retailers, laundromats, chefs, musicians, etc. in 2009.  It is a far
cry from the enumerated make-up artists, stuntmen, set builders,
writers, and actors.  Reid's phrase, "the movie industry alone," is
similarly deceptive.

Most of those 2.2 million workers are the dry cleaners.  And I think
that very few of them would lose their jobs if the movie industry
simply ceased to exist, which is not what is at stake.

Ironically, I see no reason why those "430,000 jobs in related
businesses" couldn't be jobs with companies involved in the piracy of
movies, or, more reasonably, companies who would be fucked by the
consequences of legislation like PIPA.

What is most irksome is that Reid is happy to parrot a misleading
factoid *directly* from the MPAA's website, when the government spends
several billion dollars a year on the [Census Bureau][].  Which does
its own [Economic Census] every five years, and keeps other tabs annually.

So what information cost several billions of dollars for Reid to blow
off in favor of his donors?  I looked up employment by
[NAICS category][], which is 512110 for "Motion Picture and Video
Production".

  [NAICS category]: http://www.census.gov/epcd/naics02/def/ND512110.HTM

There were 146,539 "Paid employees for pay period including March 12
(number)" in 2009.  [Check it out](http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=BP_2009_00A1&prodType=table).
